# Text-Editor-App

## Description

In this UofT Bootcamp challenge, we were tasked with completing a basic text editor app that we can deploy with a webpack. It challenged our understanding of how to configure a webpackage, the service workers and the organization of server side and client side resources.

## Usage

You can run the app using npm run start:dev and then npm run start. This will build the webpack and launch the server on the local host. From the local host, you can use the app, but also install the app to you device locally by clicking the install button.
